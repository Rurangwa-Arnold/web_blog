            Study Shows Increased Screen Time During Pandemic Affects Children's Mental Health
            The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many children to stay indoors and rely on screens for entertainment and education. A
            recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that increased screen time during
            the pandemic has negatively impacted the mental health of children.
            The study surveyed over 2,000 children aged 8-12 years old and their parents in the United States. It found that
            children who spent more than seven hours a day on screens had higher rates of anxiety and depression than those who
            spent less than an hour a day. The study also found that children who spent more time on screens were more likely to
            have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep.
            Dr. Jane Smith, a pediatrician and one of the authors of the study, said that the findings highlight the need for
            parents to monitor their children's screen time and encourage other activities. "Screen time is not inherently bad, but
            too much of it can have negative effects on children's mental health," she said. "Parents should try to limit their
            children's screen time and encourage them to engage in other activities like reading, playing outside, or spending time
            with family."
            The study also found that children who had more social support from their families and friends had better mental health
            outcomes. "It's important for parents to stay connected with their children and provide emotional support during these
            challenging times," said Dr. Smith.
            The findings of the study underscore the importance of balancing screen time with other activities and providing
            children with social support. As the pandemic continues, parents should be mindful of their children's mental health and
            take steps to promote healthy habits.

              Poland has a long and rich history of education, with the first university in the country founded in the 14th century.
              Today, education in Poland is highly regarded and valued, with a strong emphasis on academic achievement and
              intellectual development.
              The Polish education system is divided into three levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary education is
              compulsory for all children aged 6-7 to 13-14, and is focused on developing basic skills in reading, writing, and
              mathematics. Secondary education is divided into two stages: lower secondary and upper secondary. Lower secondary
              education is compulsory and lasts for three years, while upper secondary education is voluntary and lasts for another
              three years. Upper secondary education prepares students for higher education or vocational training.
              Polish universities are highly regarded and attract students from all over the world. The country has a strong tradition
              of research and academic excellence, with many universities ranking highly in international rankings. The most
              prestigious universities in Poland include the University of Warsaw, Jagiellonian University in Krakow, and Adam
              Mickiewicz University in Poznan.
              The Polish government places a high priority on education, with public spending on education accounting for a
              significant portion of the national budget. The government also provides financial support for students who come from
              low-income families, making education accessible to all.
              Poland's education system has undergone significant changes in recent years, with a focus on modernizing the curriculum
              and incorporating new technologies into the classroom. The country has also placed a greater emphasis on vocational
              education, with the aim of providing students with the skills they need to succeed in the modern workforce.
              Overall, education in Poland is highly valued and respected, with a strong emphasis on academic achievement and
              intellectual development. The country's universities are world-renowned, and the government is committed to providing
              access to education for all. With a focus on modernizing the curriculum and incorporating new technologies into the
              classroom, Poland is well-positioned to continue to provide high-quality education for its students well into the
              future.

                The natural environment plays a crucial role in our lives, providing us with the air we breathe, the water we drink, and
                the food we eat. It is the foundation of our existence, and yet we often take it for granted. The natural environment is
                under threat from a range of factors, including climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction. In this article, we
                will explore the importance of the natural environment and the steps we can take to protect it.
                One of the most pressing issues facing the natural environment is climate change. The burning of fossil fuels is
                releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, causing the planet to warm at an alarming rate. This
                warming is causing glaciers to melt, sea levels to rise, and weather patterns to become more extreme. The effects of
                climate change are already being felt around the world, with more frequent and severe heatwaves, droughts, and floods.
                Another major threat to the natural environment is pollution. The release of chemicals and waste products into the air,
                water, and soil is harming wildlife, ecosystems, and human health. Plastic pollution is a particular concern, with
                millions of tonnes of plastic waste entering the oceans every year. This waste is killing marine life and entering the
                food chain, with potential impacts on human health.
                Habitat destruction is also a significant threat to the natural environment. The destruction of forests, wetlands, and
                other ecosystems is causing the loss of biodiversity and the extinction of species. This loss of biodiversity is not
                only a tragedy in itself, but it also has broader implications for human health and wellbeing.
                So, what can we do to protect the natural environment? There are many steps we can take, both as individuals and as a
                society. One of the most important things we can do is reduce our carbon footprint by using renewable energy, driving
                less, and eating a plant-based diet. We can also reduce our use of single-use plastics, recycle more, and support
                companies that are committed to sustainability.
                On a larger scale, governments and businesses have a crucial role to play in protecting the natural environment.
                Governments can introduce policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, protect habitats, and promote sustainable
                development. Businesses can adopt sustainable practices, such as using renewable energy, reducing waste, and sourcing
                materials responsibly.
                In conclusion, the natural environment is essential to our survival and wellbeing. It is under threat from a range of
                factors, including climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction. However, there are many steps we can take to
                protect the natural environment, both as individuals and as a society. By working together, we can ensure that future
                generations can enjoy the same benefits from the natural environment that we do today.
